			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacock is one of the most beautiful birds on earth. It is particularly known for its colourful feathers that are a sight to behold. It looks best when it dances merrily in the rain.</p>
			<div class="bg-demo">
				<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacock is known for its mesmerising beauty. This beautiful bird comes in different colours. There are mainly three species of peacock. These are the Indian peacock (found in India and Sri Lanka), the Green Peacock (found in Indonesia) and the Congo Peacock (found in Africa). While the Indian and Green peacock have an elaborate crest on their head and long colourful plumage, Congo peacock on the other hand, has a less attractive crest and short tail. Both Indian and Green peacock look extremely beautiful whereas the Congo peacock appears rather dull. The colour of the body and crest is what mainly distinguishes the Indian peacock from the Green peacock. The Indian peacock has a blue coloured body whereas the Green peacock has a green coloured body.</p>
